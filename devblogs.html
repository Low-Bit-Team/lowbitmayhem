   <h1>Devblog #1</h1>
   <p>Heyo everyone, hope you enjoyed the April Fools update of Low-Bit Mayhem. Figured I'd write up an update about the recent update, what's been done since the update, and the future of the mod as a whole.</p>
   <h2>April Fools Update</h2>
   <p>Yeah, if you couldn't tell from the release date of the most recent update, it was an update made for April Fools. I'm not gonna explain why the update is what it is since it's explained in-game, so you should play it for yourself. However...</p>
   <h2>Bit-Beat (Pico Mix)</h2>
   <p>As teased in the AF update, Bit-Beat is getting a Pico Mix in v2! We're gonna try to attempt a whole new style for this one, so stay tuned for any visual teasers.</p>
   <h2>Low-Bit Mayhem Socials</h2>
   <p>Recently, we created socials for Low-Bit Mayhem on both BlueSky & Twitter. We'll be posting more teasers and both as things progress, so make sure to follow one or both of the accounts for more!</p>
